Once there was a Lion in the jungle who used to kill animals daily for his meal.
All animals went to to the lion.
that daily one of the animals will come for the lion's meal.
So.
the Lion agreed and this started going for many days.
One day.
it was Rabbitâ€™s turn.
When he was on his way he saw a well.
Now he plans to kill the lion and save himself.
He went to the lion and told him that.
there is another lion who claims to be more powerful than him.
Then the lion asks the rabbit to take him to that lion.
The rabbit takes him to the well and said he lives here.
When the lion looked in the well he saw his own reflection.
The lion jumped in the well and dies.
